Otherwise you can create a virtual environment.

```
### Activate virual environment.

- Windows ->

```bash
name_of_the_env\Scripts\activate
```
- Linux ->

```bash
source name_of_the_env/bin/activate
```

### Deactivate virual environment.
``` bash
    deactivate
```

### To install all from requirments.txt
``` bash
    pip install -r requirments.txt
```
